          Welcome to my Web Devlopment Portfolio. I moved to Washington about 5
          years ago since i love the cooler weather and rain. Currently I work
          at PPG as a Production Planner. I have 2 dog's (Addie and Aiden) who
          are 9 years old. My girlfriend likes finding any reason for us to take
          the dogs out somewhere. When possible I will do some work on my car. I
          am a JR Web Developer. I am currently working with HTML, CSS, and
          Javascript, and I am working on Python on the side. I really like the
          concept of machine learning and AI. Although it requires advanced math and 
          algorithmsthat I need to learn before i consider working with it.
